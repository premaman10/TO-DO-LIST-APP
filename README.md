# TO-DO-LIST-APP
This repository contains a basic To-Do List app developed in Kotlin and XML as part of my 3-month summer training internship in Android development at Fifth Force. The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks, and features a RecyclerView to display the list of tasks efficiently.
